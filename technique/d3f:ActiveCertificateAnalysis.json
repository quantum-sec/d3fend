TLS is the\nmost widely used security protocol to secure web transactions and other communications on the\ninternet and internal networks. TLS server certificates are central to the security and operation of\ninternet-facing and internal web services. Improper TLS server certificate management results in\nsignificant outages to web applications and services—such as government services, online banking, flight operations, and mission-critical services within an organization—and increased risk of security breaches.","d3f:kb-author":"William Haag, Murugiah Souppaya, Paul Turner, William C.
