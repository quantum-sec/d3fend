When an event log gets cleared, it is suspicious. Alerting when a “Clear Event Log” is generated could point to this intruder technique. Centrally collecting events has the added benefit of making it much harder for attackers to cover their tracks. Event Forwarding permits sources to forward multiple copies of a collected event to multiple collectors, thus enabling redundant event collection. Using a redundant event collection model can minimize the single point of failure risk.","d3f:kb-author":"MITRE","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:SystemFileAnalysis"},"d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"","d3f:kb-organization":"MITRE","d3f:kb-reference-title":"CAR-2016-04-002: User Activity from Clearing Event Logs","d3f:reference-type-label":"External Knowledge Base","rdfs:label":"Reference - CAR-2016-04-002: User Activity from Clearing Event Logs - MITRE"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference_HostIntrusionPreventionSystemUsingSoftwareAndUserBehaviorAnalysis_SophosLtd","@type":["d3f:PatentReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110023115A1"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"In embodiments of the present invention improved capabilities are described for threat detection using a behavioral-based host-intrusion prevention method and system for monitoring a user interaction with a computer, software application, operating system, graphic user interface, or some other component or client of a computer network, and performing an action to protect the computer network based at least in part on the user interaction and a computer code process executing during or in association with a computer usage session.","d3f:kb-author":"Clifford C.

User and code behavior data is collected and stored to create baseline user and code behavior profiles. User behavior data collected over a user session or over multiple sessions can include a user:\n\n* clicking on a link\n* scrolling down a page\n* opening or closing a window\n* downloading a file\n* saving a file\n* running a file\n* typing a keyword\n\nCode behavior monitored includes code:\n\n* copying itself to a system folder\n* setting a run key to itself in the registry\n* setting a second runkey to itself in the registry in\na different location\n* disabling OS tools in the registry\n* opening a hidden file\n \nThe user interaction and the code process executed during the user session are monitored and compared with predetermined malicious behavior profiles that are typically present in a malicious user session.  The predetermined collection of malicious behaviors are created based on analysis of families of malware in run time in a threat research facility. If a match is made an action is taken that can include isolating the computer on which the user interaction occurs and limiting network access to or from the computer.","d3f:kb-organization":"Sophos Ltd","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Host intrusion prevention system using software and user behavior analysis","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Host intrusion prevention system using software and user behavior analysis - Sophos Ltd"}]},"references_meta":{"External Knowledge Base":1,"Patent":1}}
