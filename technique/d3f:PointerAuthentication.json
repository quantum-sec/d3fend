I then demonstrate a way to use an arbitrary kernel read/write primitive to forge kernel PAC signatures for the A keys, which is sufficient to execute arbitrary code in the kernel using JOP. The technique I discovered was (mostly) fixed in iOS 12.1.3. In fact, this fix first appeared in the 16D5032a beta while my research was still ongoing.","d3f:kb-author":"Brandon Azad","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:PointerAuthentication"},"d3f:kb-organization":"Project Zero, Google, Inc","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Examining Pointer Authentication on the iPhone XS","d3f:reference-type-label":"Internet Article","rdfs:label":"Reference - Pointer Authentication Project Zero"}]},"references_meta":{"Specification":1,"Internet Article":1}}
