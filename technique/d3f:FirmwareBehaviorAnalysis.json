It is often\ninfeasible, however, to employ the same level of security measures used in general purpose computing systems, due to the stringent\nperformance and resource constraints of embedded devices. Furthermore, as software relies on the firmware for proper operation,\nno software-level technique can detect malicious behavior of\nthe firmware. In this work, we propose ConFirm, a low-cost\ntechnique to detect malicious modifications in the firmware\nof embedded systems by measuring the number of low-level hardware events that occur during the execution of the firmware.","d3f:kb-author":"Xueyang Wang, Charalambos Konstantinou, Michail Maniatakos, Ramesh Karri","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:FirmwareBehaviorAnalysis"},"d3f:kb-organization":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New York University Abu Dhabi","d3f:kb-reference-title":"ConFirm: Detecting Firmware Modifications in Embedded Systems\nusing Hardware Performance Counters","d3f:reference-type-label":"Academic Paper","rdfs:label":"Reference - Firmware Behavior Analysis ConFirm"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference-FirmwareBehaviorAnalysisVIPER","@type":["d3f:AcademicPaperReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2046707.2046711"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"Recent research demonstrates that malware can infect peripherals' firmware in a typical x86 computer system, e.g., by exploiting vulnerabilities in the firmware itself or in the firmware update tools.
