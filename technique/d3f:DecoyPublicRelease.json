The user action may be in response to a mock attack delivered via a messaging service, a wireless communication service, a fake malware application or another device, service, system or mechanism. The system selects a training action from a collection of available training actions and causes the training action to be delivered to the user.","d3f:kb-author":"Norman Sadeh-Koniecpol, Kurt Wescoe, Jason Brubaker, Jason Hong","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:DecoyPublicRelease"},"d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"","d3f:kb-organization":"WOMBAT SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES Inc","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Mock attack cybersecurity training system and methods","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Mock attack cybersecurity training system and methods - WOMBAT SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES Inc"}]},"references_meta":{"Patent":1}}
