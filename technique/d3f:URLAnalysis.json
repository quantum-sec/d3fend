URL analysis is done by using a combination of techniques:\n\n* Feature extraction: A URL is analyzed against features associated with suspicious URLs such as % of longest consecutive digits in a subdomain, % of longest repeated characters in a subdomain, % of vowels in a high level domain.  \n\n* Markov analysis: The probability of a digit occurring in normal language given the preceding two digits is determined. For example, if the received URL is google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a “g, the probability of an “o’ occurring after a 'g' and “o, and so forth will be determined. The probability of each digit is then multiplied to get a probability for the whole domain name. Probabilities are determined based on a database of existing usage, such as a dictionary, or a list of known good domain names \n\n* Domain names are compared against an existing dataset of known unauthorized domain names.\n\nA rating is developed based on the results of these techniques, and if the rating is over a set threshold, an action is taken such as blocking access or generating an alert.","d3f:kb-organization":"Endgame Inc","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Method and Apparatus for Detecting Malicious Websites","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Method and Apparatus for Detecting Malicious Websites - Endgame Inc"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference_MethodAndSystemForDetectingRestrictedContentAssociatedWithRetrievedContent_SophosLtd","@type":["d3f:PatentReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160359883A1"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"In embodiments of the present invention improved capabilities are described for detecting restricted content associated with retrieved content.
