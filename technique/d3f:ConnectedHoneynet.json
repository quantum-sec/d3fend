For example, a method can include determining a deception characteristic of a deception mechanism and determining a production characteristic of the production system. The method can further include determining an additional service or a modification of an existing service of the production system using the deception characteristic and the production characteristic. In some cases, the additional service and/or the modification can be a deterrent to potential attackers of the production system. The method can further include modifying the production system to mimic the deception mechanism, including adding the additional service to the production system or modifying the existing service using the modification.","d3f:kb-author":"Sreenivas Gukal, Rammohan Varadarajan","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:ConnectedHoneynet"},"d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"","d3f:kb-organization":"Acalvio Technologies Inc","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Modification of a Server to Mimic a Deception Mechanism","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Modification of a Server to Mimic a Deception Mechanism - Acalvio Technologies Inc"}]},"references_meta":{"Patent":1}}
