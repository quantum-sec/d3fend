By exploiting the electrical characteristics of the PC keyboard interface together with modifications to the internal system timer, very accurate measurements can be made of keystroke interval and duration, including measurements of rollover. Rollover patterns, particularly when typing common diphthongs, can be highly characteristic of individual users and provide quite an accurate indication of the users identity.\nPublished in: European Convention on Security and Detection, 1995.","d3f:kb-author":"S.J.

Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric, this means that the biometric factor is ‘something you do’.\n\nAlready during the second world war a technique known as The Fist of the Sender was used by military intelligence to distinguish based on the rhythm whether a morse code message was send by ally or enemy. These days each household has at least one computer keyboard, making keystroke dynamics the easiest biometric solution to implement in terms of hardware.\n\nWith keystroke dynamics the biometric template used to identify an individual is based on the typing pattern, the rhythm and the speed of typing on a keyboard. The raw measurements used for keystroke dynamics are dwell time and flight time.","d3f:kb-author":"Biometric Solutions","d3f:kb-is-example-of":{"@id":"d3f:InputDeviceAnalysis"},"d3f:kb-mitre-analysis":"","d3f:kb-organization":"Biometric Solutions","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Keystroke Dynamics","d3f:reference-type-label":"Internet Article","rdfs:label":"Reference - http://www.biometric-solutions.com/keystroke-dynamics.html - biometric-solutions.com"}]},"references_meta":{"Academic Paper":1,"Internet Article":1}}
