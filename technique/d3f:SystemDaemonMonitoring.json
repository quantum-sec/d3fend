User and code behavior data is collected and stored to create baseline user and code behavior profiles. User behavior data collected over a user session or over multiple sessions can include a user:\n\n* clicking on a link\n* scrolling down a page\n* opening or closing a window\n* downloading a file\n* saving a file\n* running a file\n* typing a keyword\n\nCode behavior monitored includes code:\n\n* copying itself to a system folder\n* setting a run key to itself in the registry\n* setting a second runkey to itself in the registry in\na different location\n* disabling OS tools in the registry\n* opening a hidden file\n \nThe user interaction and the code process executed during the user session are monitored and compared with predetermined malicious behavior profiles that are typically present in a malicious user session.  The predetermined collection of malicious behaviors are created based on analysis of families of malware in run time in a threat research facility. If a match is made an action is taken that can include isolating the computer on which the user interaction occurs and limiting network access to or from the computer.","d3f:kb-organization":"Sophos Ltd","d3f:kb-reference-title":"Host intrusion prevention system using software and user behavior analysis","d3f:reference-type-label":"Patent","rdfs:label":"Reference - Host intrusion prevention system using software and user behavior analysis - Sophos Ltd"},{"@id":"d3f:Reference_MethodUsingKernelModeAssistanceForTheDetectionAndRemovalOfThreatsWhichAreActivelyPreventingDetectionAndRemovalFromARunningSystem_SymantecCorporation","@type":["d3f:PatentReference","http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#NamedIndividual"],"d3f:has-link":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI","@value":"https://patents.google.com/patent/US8239947B1"},"d3f:kb-abstract":"A user mode application component invokes the assistance of a kernel mode driver component to detect and/or remediate malicious code on a computer system.
