The AP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from a hotspot which is a physical location where Wi-Fi access is available.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Wireless_access_point"},"rdfs:label":"Wireless Access Point","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:NetworkNode"},"skos:altLabel":"WAP"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Wireless_access_point"}]}}
