Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally, and may not support access to a cellular network.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Tablet_computer"},"rdfs:label":"Tablet Computer","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:PersonalComputer"},"skos:altLabel":"Tablet"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Tablet_computer"}]}}
