Domain names are one of the two principal namespaces of the Internet. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable domain names and hostnames into the corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet. (en). \n\nMore generally, a name server is a computer application that implements a network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service. It translates an often humanly meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This service is performed by the server in response to a service protocol request.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Name_server"},"rdfs:label":"DNS Server","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:Server"}},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"d3f:Server"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Name_server"}]}}
