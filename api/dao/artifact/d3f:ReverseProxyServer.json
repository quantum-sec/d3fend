These resources are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself. Unlike a forward proxy, which is an intermediary for its associated clients to contact any server, a reverse proxy is an intermediary for its associated servers to be contacted by any client. In other words, a proxy acts on behalf of the client(s), while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server(s); a reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a 'front-end' to control and protect access to a server on a private network.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Reverse_proxy"},"rdfs:label":"Reverse Proxy Server","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:ProxyServer"}},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Reverse_proxy"}]}}
