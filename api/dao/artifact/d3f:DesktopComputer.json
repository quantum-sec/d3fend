The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, bus, and other electronic components, disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives, solid state drives, optical disc drives, and in early models a floppy disk drive); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a computer monitor, speakers, and, often, a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a desk.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer"},"rdfs:label":"Desktop Computer","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:PersonalComputer"}},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"d3f:PersonalComputer"},{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer"}]}}
