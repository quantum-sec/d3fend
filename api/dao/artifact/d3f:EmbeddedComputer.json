It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system"},"rdfs:label":"Embedded Computer","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:ClientComputer"},"skos:altLabel":"Embedded System"},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system"}]}}
