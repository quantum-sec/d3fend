Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. At the core of both is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations, but should not be confused with the video card as a whole, although \"GPU\" is often used to refer to video cards.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Video_card"},"rdfs:label":"Display Adapter","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:OutputDevice"},"skos:altLabel":["Display Card","Graphics Adapter","Video Card"]},{"id":"d3f:OutputDevice"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Video_card"}]}}
