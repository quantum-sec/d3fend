This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer. In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels, which enable additional control and dimensional input.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Computer_mouse"},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Input Device","rdfs:seeAlso":{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_device"},"rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:InputDevice"},"skos:altLabel":"Computer Mouse"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Computer_mouse"},{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_device"}]}}
