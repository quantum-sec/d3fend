A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Modem"},"rdfs:label":"Modem","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:NetworkNode"}},{"id":"d3f:NetworkNode"},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Modem"}]}}
