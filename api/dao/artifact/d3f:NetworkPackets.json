Computer communications links that do not support packets, such as traditional point-to-point telecommunications links, simply transmit data as a bit stream. When data is formatted into packets, packet switching is possible and the bandwidth of the communication medium can be better shared among users than with circuit switching.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"http://dbpedia.org/page/Network_packet"},"rdfs:label":"Network Packet","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:NetworkTraffic"}},{"id":"d3f:NetworkTraffic"},{"id":"d3f:PhysicalLocation"},{"id":"http://dbpedia.org/page/Network_packet"}]}}
