A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet. Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Firewall_(computing)"},"rdfs:label":"Firewall","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:NetworkNode"}},{"id":"d3f:NetworkNode"},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Firewall_(computing)"}]}}
