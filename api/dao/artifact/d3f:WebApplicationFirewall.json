A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a safety gate between servers. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Web_application_firewall"},"rdfs:label":"Web Application Firewall","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:ApplicationLayerFirewall"},"skos:altLabel":"WAF"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Web_application_firewall"}]}}
