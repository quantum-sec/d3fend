A software repository, or “repo” for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is stored, as well as metadata. Repositories group packages. Sometimes the grouping is for a programming language, such as CPAN for the Perl programming language, sometimes for an entire operating system, sometimes the license of the contents is the criteria. At client side, a package manager helps installing from and updating the repositories.","rdfs:label":"Software Artifact Server","rdfs:seeAlso":[{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Software_repository"},{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)"}],"rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:ArtifactServer"}},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Software_repository"},{"id":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)"}]}}
