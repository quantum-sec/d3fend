The content repository or content store is a database of digital content with an associated set of data management, search and access methods allowing application-independent access to the content, rather like a digital library, but with the ability to store and modify content in addition to searching and retrieving. The content repository acts as the storage engine for a larger application such as a content management system or a document management system, which adds a user interface on top of the repository's application programming interface.","rdfs:label":"Data Artifact Server","rdfs:seeAlso":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Content_repository"},"rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:ArtifactServer"}},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Content_repository"}]}}
