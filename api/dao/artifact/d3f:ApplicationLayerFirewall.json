It operates by monitoring and potentially blocking the input, output, or system service calls that do not meet the configured policy of the firewall. The application firewall is typically built to control all network traffic on any OSI layer up to the application layer. It is able to control applications or services specifically, unlike a stateful network firewall, which is - without additional software - unable to control network traffic regarding a specific application. There are two primary categories of application firewalls, network-based application firewalls and host-based application firewalls.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Application_firewall"},"rdfs:label":"Application Layer Firewall","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:Firewall"},"skos:altLabel":"Application Firewall"},{"id":"d3f:Firewall"},{"id":"d3f:OperatingSystem"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/Application_firewall"}]}}
