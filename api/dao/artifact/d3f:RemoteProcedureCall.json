That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. The object-oriented programming analog is remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"http://dbpedia.org/page/Remote_procedure_call"},"rdfs:label":"Remote Procedure Call","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:RemoteCommand"}},{"id":"http://dbpedia.org/page/Remote_procedure_call"}]}}
