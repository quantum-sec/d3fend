Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.","rdfs:isDefinedBy":{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/IP_address"},"rdfs:label":"IP Address","rdfs:subClassOf":{"id":"d3f:Identifier"}},{"id":"d3f:Identifier"},{"id":"https://dbpedia.org/page/IP_address"}]}}
